WELCOME!
For my next assignment! I bring you the Question & Answers Site!
This is my new web app! This app will allow users to register and sign in!
Not only that but it will allow users to view questions and answers, and edit the field they like!

(What I used): Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
